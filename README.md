### 1. Mini Project 1: Color Detection 🛬 
**Harnessing Vision with the Parrot Mambo’s Camera**

![Demo 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22020549-48d6-4dfe-9658-e8772a628fb7)

Imagine a drone that doesn’t just fly—it *sees*. In this project, we transformed the Parrot Mambo into a **color-detection expert**, leveraging its onboard camera to pinpoint Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow targets with surgical precision. Powered by MATLAB and Simulink, this system demonstrates robust object recognition in real time. It’s a perfect blend of hardware and algorithmic finesse, ideal for anyone looking to explore vision-based robotics. Check out the code and see how we made it happen!

Take the helm and command the skies! This project elevates the Parrot Mambo into a **keyboard-driven navigator** with a brain for color-based landings. Pilot it with intuitive controls (‘w’, ‘a’, ‘s’, ‘d’) to zero in on a colored target, then watch it execute a flawless, controlled descent—all autonomously triggered by vision data. It’s a marriage of manual dexterity and smart automation, built for those who thrive on technical challenges. Ready to test your skills?

### 3. Mini Project 3: Autonomous Line Following & Precision Landing 🤖  
**Fully Autonomous Navigation with Real-Time Computer Vision**

In this advanced autonomous system, the Parrot Mambo becomes a self-navigating robot. Using only its downward-facing camera, the drone detects and follows an RGB line with real-time image processing. Upon recognizing symmetry in the visual data, it performs an **autonomous landing** with smooth, controlled descent—no manual intervention needed.  

This project combines the power of MATLAB’s Color Thresholder with Simulink’s Stateflow logic and serves as a foundation for future research in dynamic path planning and visual servoing.

### 4. Mini Project 4: Vision-Guided Precision Landing on a Moving Robot 🎯🚘  

![Parrot Mambo Landing Demo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/134625fe-b997-42a7-aa94-ea749ca05c97)

This was the most technically demanding and rewarding project in the series. Here, the Parrot Mambo drone was challenged to autonomously **detect, track, and land on a moving line-follower robot** using its onboard downward-facing camera and real-time vision processing in Simulink.

**What made this special?**  
- Used **HSV color segmentation** for resilient platform detection under variable lighting (far outperforming RGB).
- Tuned thresholds using **multiple images from different lighting conditions** to build robust masks.
- Applied **Median filtering and Blob Analysis** for clean, reliable centroid tracking.
- Deployed a **Stateflow-based control logic** managing all flight phases: Hover ➝ Cruise ➝ Smooth Descent ➝ Soft Landing.
- Tackled tough challenges like lateral drift during descent and soft-touch touchdowns on a moving target — solved via carefully tuned proportional controls and stability timers.

**Key Learnings:**  
📝 Lighting has a huge impact on real-time vision systems.  
📝 HSV segmentation paired with multi-condition thresholding vastly improves detection robustness.  
📝 Coordinating precise landings on a moving object is hard — but achievable with tight feedback loops and well-structured control logic.

This project isn’t just a demo — it’s a working proof of vision-based dynamic UAV-UGV interaction, laying groundwork for future multi-agent, path-planning, and coordinated robotics research.
