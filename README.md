Imagine a drone that doesn’t just fly—it *sees*. In this project, we transformed the Parrot Mambo into a **color-detection expert**, leveraging its onboard camera to pinpoint Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow targets with surgical precision. Powered by MATLAB and Simulink, this system demonstrates robust object recognition in real time. It’s a perfect blend of hardware and algorithmic finesse, ideal for anyone looking to explore vision-based robotics. Check out the code and see how we made it happen!

Take the helm and command the skies! This project elevates the Parrot Mambo into a **keyboard-driven navigator** with a brain for color-based landings. Pilot it with intuitive controls (‘w’, ‘a’, ‘s’, ‘d’) to zero in on a colored target, then watch it execute a flawless, controlled descent—all autonomously triggered by vision data. It’s a marriage of manual dexterity and smart automation, built for those who thrive on technical challenges. Ready to test your skills?
