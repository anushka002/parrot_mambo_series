### 1. Mini Project 1: Color Detection üõ¨ 
**Harnessing Vision with the Parrot Mambo‚Äôs Camera**

![Demo 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22020549-48d6-4dfe-9658-e8772a628fb7)

Imagine a drone that doesn‚Äôt just fly‚Äîit *sees*. In this project, we transformed the Parrot Mambo into a **color-detection expert**, leveraging its onboard camera to pinpoint Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow targets with surgical precision. Powered by MATLAB and Simulink, this system demonstrates robust object recognition in real time. It‚Äôs a perfect blend of hardware and algorithmic finesse, ideal for anyone looking to explore vision-based robotics. Check out the code and see how we made it happen!

Take the helm and command the skies! This project elevates the Parrot Mambo into a **keyboard-driven navigator** with a brain for color-based landings. Pilot it with intuitive controls (‚Äòw‚Äô, ‚Äòa‚Äô, ‚Äòs‚Äô, ‚Äòd‚Äô) to zero in on a colored target, then watch it execute a flawless, controlled descent‚Äîall autonomously triggered by vision data. It‚Äôs a marriage of manual dexterity and smart automation, built for those who thrive on technical challenges. Ready to test your skills?

### 3. Mini Project 3: Autonomous Line Following & Precision Landing ü§ñ  
**Fully Autonomous Navigation with Real-Time Computer Vision**

![line-following-demo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/your-upcoming-gif-placeholder.gif)

In this advanced autonomous system, the Parrot Mambo becomes a self-navigating robot. Using only its downward-facing camera, the drone detects and follows an RGB line with real-time image processing. Upon recognizing symmetry in the visual data, it performs an **autonomous landing** with smooth, controlled descent‚Äîno manual intervention needed.  

This project combines the power of MATLAB‚Äôs Color Thresholder with Simulink‚Äôs Stateflow logic and serves as a foundation for future research in dynamic path planning and visual servoing.
